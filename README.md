# Likemind Challenge

Hey there,
Welcome to my challenge!

In order to connect to the API I needed to make a proxy (with express)
because I was getting a CORS error and I couldn't get past it

So to make this work, you can download the proxy from:
https://github.com/ruybarriopedro00/likemindChallengeProxy.git
and add the quotes URL in 'index.js' at line 9 (I deleted it because this repository is public)
then run 'npm install' in the terminal, and 'npm start' after that.

Also, dont forget to run 'npm start' and 'npm install' for this project as well.
